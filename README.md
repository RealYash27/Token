This project showcases the creation and deployment of a custom token on the Conflux eSpace Testnet, emphasizing the process of token development and its seamless integration with blockchain applications.  

Key Highlights:  
- **Token Creation**: Designed and deployed a custom token, **MTken (MTK)**, using Solidity. Key attributes such as token name, symbol, decimals, and initial supply were defined during deployment, ensuring a tailored token to meet specific use cases.  
- **Blockchain Deployment**: Utilized the Conflux eSpace Testnet to deploy the token smart contract, leveraging its EVM-compatible architecture for efficient interaction and scalability.  
- **Transaction Management**: Implemented token management functionality, including balance queries, token transfers, approvals, and transaction handling, using Web3.py and Python.  
- **Development and Testing**: Focused on testing and optimizing token functionality in a secure and decentralized environment, enabling seamless integration with existing blockchain solutions.  

This project primarily serves as a guide for blockchain developers to understand the token creation process while providing secondary insights into managing and interacting with tokens on EVM-compatible networks.
